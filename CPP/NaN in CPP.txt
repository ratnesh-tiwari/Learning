How to check for NaN ?

Method_01: Using compare (“==”) operator

-number is compared with itself
- if result is false, then “nan” is returned, i.e the number is complex
-If the result is true, then the number is not complex



Method_02: Using inbuilt function “isnan()”
-returns true if a number is complex else it returns false
